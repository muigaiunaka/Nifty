#Nifty

Nifty is a platform that provides users on-demand, hyper-localized access to clothing items and a wide variety of styles for a fraction of the cost, financial and environmental, of owning these styles through the creation of “intelligent closets” in which users are able to treat their closets as boutiques and essentially rent out curated dresses and outfits to other users around them.
